Welcome to the Chemistry Lab VR. Your first experiment is to determine metallic ions of chloride salts using a flame test.<br><br>On the lab bench you can see five beakers each containing a different metal chloride solution. #line:06a7c78 


//Element 1
The first solution is Potassium Chloride. #line:0b946e6 

//Element 2
The second solution is Lithium Chloride. #line:0dc4461 

//Element 3
The third solution is Calcium Chloride. #line:0890700 

//Element 4
The fourth solution is Copper Chloride. #line:0116664 

//Element 5
And the fifth solution is Sodium Chloride. #line:03ae5e1 


//Element 6
Hold up each beaker to inspect the color of the salt solution. As you can see only the copper chloride solution has a light blue color. The rest are clear. Once you're done click Next to continue. #line:0561553

//Element 7
To execute the flame test, you will need to use the Bunsen burner to your left. #line:01a1276 

//Element 8
For this experiment, the bunsen burner has been lit up for you. #line:0dcb00d 

//Element 9
Notice the color of the flame.<br><br>The flame has a bluish color and burns with a roaring sound.This is a luminous flame and is produced when the airhole is open. #line:0b74b90 

//Element 10
Most of the chemistry experiments you will do in the lab will require this type of flame.<br><br>Once you're comfortable, press the Next button to continue to the next part of the experiment. #line:03a587d

//Element 11
Now take the Nichrome wire that we also call the test wire and dip it in the first beaker containing Potassium Chloride. #line:0ab139d 

//Element 12
Hold the end of the test wire into the flame, and observe how the flame changes color. #line:07ef0d2 

//Element 13
The flame should present a lilac color. A lilac color appears in the flame when Potassium ions are present. #line:05dd2bc 



//Element 14
Before testing the next solution, we must remove all the potassium chloride from the test wire. #line:040f39f 

//Element 15
To do this, hold the end of the wire into the flame until it glows orange. Then remove the test wire from the flame and allow to cool for 7 seconds. #line:0c1ae93 




//Element 16
Now dip the wire into the second beaker containing Lithium Chloride and repeat the test.<br><br>A crimson color appears in the flame when Lithium ions are present. #line:0576390 

//Element 17
Remember to clean the Nichrome wire once you're done. #line:0278b8b 



//Element 18
Now dip the wire into the third beaker containing Calcium Chloride and repeat the test.<br><br>A red-orange color appears in the flame when Calcium ions are present. #line:0efd6b3 

//Element 19
Once again clean the Nichrome wire by holding in the flame. #line:0a7d386 




//Element 20
Now dip the wire into the fouth beaker containing Copper Chloride and repeat the test.<br><br>A green color appears in the flame when Copper ions are present. #line:0d92fa6 

//Element 21
Don't forget to clean the Nichrome wire once you're done. #line:0d555eb 




//Element 22
Finally, dip the wire into the fifth beaker containing Sodium Chloride and repeat the test.<br><br>An orange color appears in the flame when Sodium ions are present. #line:0f368de 

//Element 23
Clean the Nichrome wire one last time. #line:0acc392 



//Element 24
Congratulations on reaching the end of the experiment. Proceed to the test section if you're comfortable or replay the experience. #line:0ef2a40
